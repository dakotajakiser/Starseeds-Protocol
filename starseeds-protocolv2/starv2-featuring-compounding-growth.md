# STARv2: Liquidity Enhancements

A STARv2 superpool on balancer is being built in such a way that gives STARv2 easy trade-ability with most stablecoins and a exceptional APR linked to the returns of the other tokens in the pool. \
\
The superpool is designed to be made of\
33% STARv2\
33% STARD (3 layered Stablepool set with tetu and balancer boosted USDC, DAI, USDT, wUSDR, USDR, USD+,  and compounding wUSDR-USDR on the pearl exchange. 15% target APR.\
33% in a autocompounding collection of 50% tangible-usdr, 20% wbtc-usdr, 20% eth-usdr and Tetu USD. \
\
We are designing an arbitrage bot that is able to pack and unpack the multistep compounding tokens used in our BP to generate additional revenues, which are then split between buying and burning STARV2 and being placed into the DAO controlled Treasury.&#x20;
