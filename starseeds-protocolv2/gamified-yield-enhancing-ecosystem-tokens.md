# Gamified Yield Enhancing Ecosystem Tokens

An optional aspect of the V2 StarSeeds ecosystem is a gamified set of items, staking contracts and tokens that provide people with very little funds a method to slowly grow their holdings. \
\
This gamification also serves as a method to incentivize keeping liquidity locked within our ecosystem so the Protocol can continue compounding yields. \
\
The end result of the game is a percentage increase to the base, regenerative yields offered to our platform users. \
\
