# Gamified Yield Enhancing Ecosystem Tokens

An optional aspect of the V2 StarSeeds ecosystem is a gamified set of items, staking contracts and tokens that provide people with very little funds a method to slowly grow their holdings. \
\
This gamification also serves as a method to incentivize keeping liquidity locked within our ecosystem so the Protocol can continue compounding yields. \
\
The end result of the game is a percentage increase to the base, regenerative yields offered to our platform users. \
\
STARCredits. This token is our gateway to the more gamified elements of the platform. Directly paired to STARv2, and the rest of the tokens in our game ecosystem.\
\
STARMatter. Harvested by Martial Flip and Arcturian Moon Stations.&#x20;

STARAlloys Forged by Arcturian Moon Stations from STARMatter.\
\
STARPower created by STARPGenerators.\
\
STARMatter and STARAlloys are used alongside STARCredits and STARPower to upgrade StarStations, which increases their daily yield.&#x20;
