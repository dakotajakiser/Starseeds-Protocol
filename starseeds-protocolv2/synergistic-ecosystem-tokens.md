# Synergistic Ecosystem Tokens

In addition to STARv2, The Protocol now includes a set of other tokens with specific benefits. \
\
STARDollars. An over-colleratalized stabletoken using Wusdr/USD+/gDAI to give holders both increasing capital gains and divid-end payments. In addition we use curve and balancer stabletoken technologies to grow significant liquidity. Users are offered even high gains by making a minimum 1 week conversion of the token into wSTARD, which allows us to take underlying Wusdr/USD+ and farm it, typically doubling or more the returns from simply token. \
\
85% of the gains of this technology are passed onto the user. The rest are awarded to the StarSeeds Treasury.

\
STARPower. A deflationary farm token without a tightly controlled value/collateralization. This token we can issue much more freely for engagement/marketing/partnership campaigns. It's primary utility comes from\
1\. Using with with a STARPower Generator (NFT Vault) to generate an exceptional yield paid not only in STARPower, but also in STARv2. \
2\. STARPower can be burned as a method to increase yields for staking other NFT ecosystem assets.\
3\. STARPower is meant to be farmed, rather then traded, as such there is a 0.1% burn and 1% tax on transfer. \
\
The combination of effects from burning tokens and reducing the maximum supply will , eventually balancing the tokens market value.\
\
STARCredits. This token is our gateway to the more gamified elements of the platform. Directly paired to STARv2, and the rest of the tokens in our game ecosystem.\
