# STARPower

STARPower. A deflationary farm token without a tightly controlled value/collateralization. This token can be issued much more freely for engagement/marketing/partnership campaign compared to STARv2, which is extremely regulated. \
\
STARPs utility and value comes from\
\
1\. Burning the token to mint, stake, or upgrade a STARPower Generator (NFT Vault) to generate a yield paid in STARP and eventually STARC, which is a token backed by revenues from the StarSeeds Treasury of DAO governance holdings and decentralized trading strategies.&#x20;

2\. STARP can be burned as a method to increase yields for staking other StarSeeds Protocols tokens and virtual items.&#x20;

3\. STARP is meant to be farmed, rather then traded, as such there is a 20% burn and 10% tax on transfer.&#x20;

4\. Burned STARP permanently reduces the maximum supply, which started at 10M.&#x20;

This combination of incentives to obtain and then burn STARP, thus reducing the maximum supply is designed to eventually balance STARPs market value in per portion to the value of the StarSeeds Protocols ecosystem.

\
STARPower and STARP Generator yield producing NFTs are launching first on Fantom at Beets.fi. STARP is being bootstrapped on Beets launchpad, paired with Beets (and other tokens) on the Beets Exchange. FTM STARP Generators will require both STARP and Beets to mint and stake.&#x20;
