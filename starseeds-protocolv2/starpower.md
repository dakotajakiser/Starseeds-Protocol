# STARPower

STARPower. A deflationary farm token without a tightly controlled value/collateralization. This token we can issue much more freely for engagement/marketing/partnership campaigns. It's primary utility comes from\
\
1\. Burning the token to mint or stake a STARPower Generator (NFT Vault) to generate an exceptional yield paid not only in STARPower, but also in STARC. \
2\. STARPower can be burned as a method to increase yields for staking other NFT ecosystem assets.\
3\. STARPower is meant to be farmed, rather then traded, as such there is a 10% burn and 10% tax on transfer. \
\
The combination of effects from burning tokens and reducing the maximum supply is designed to eventually balancing the tokens market value.

\
STARPower and STARP Generator yield producing NFTs are launching first on Fantom at Beets.fi. STARP is being bootstrapped on Beets launchpad, paired with Beets (and other tokens) on the Beets Exchange, and STARP Generators will require both STARP and Beets to mint.&#x20;
