# STARPower

STARPower. A deflationary farm token without a tightly controlled value/collateralization. This token can be issued much more freely for engagement/marketing/partnership campaign compared to STARv2, which is extremely regulated. \
\
STARPs utility and value comes from\
\
1\. Burning the token to mint or stake a STARPower Generator (NFT Vault) to generate an exceptional yield paid not only in STARPower, but also in STARC. \
2\. STARPower can be burned as a method to increase yields for staking other NFT ecosystem assets.\
3\. STARPower is meant to be farmed and then used, rather then traded, as such there is a 20% burn and 10% tax on transfer. \
\
The combination of incentives to buy and then burn STARP are designed to reduce the maximum until eventually the tokens market value becomes balanced in perportion to the value of the StarSeeds V2 ecosystem.&#x20;

\
STARPower and STARP Generator yield producing NFTs are launching first on Fantom at Beets.fi. STARP is being bootstrapped on Beets launchpad, paired with Beets (and other tokens) on the Beets Exchange. FTM STARP Generators will require both STARP and Beets to mint and stake.&#x20;
