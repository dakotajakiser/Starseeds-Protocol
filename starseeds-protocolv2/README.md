# StarSeeds Protocol V2

The StarSeeds Protocol has undergone a significant upgrade in its second version (V2). Key contracts within the protocol have been enhanced to optimize returns, liquidity, and stability within the ecosystem. New contracts have also been deployed to augment existing systems and introduce novel features.

Contract Upgrades: Two primary contract upgrades concern the StarStations and Command Bridges. In the updated protocol, these contracts have been transformed into stakeable items, enabling users to stake their tokens. This new mechanism allows users to collect their tokens at any time instead of being restricted to weekly airdrops. The change is designed to increase protocol revenues by reducing gas fees and giving users more control over their assets.

STARV2 SuperPool Liquidity Enhancement: In the previous version of the protocol, STARV1, the STAR - MAI V2 Liquidity Pool (LP) was hosted on Quickswap, which limited the availability of critical resources and generated minimal value for the protocol or its users. This has been addressed in the new version to enhance liquidity and optimize capital usage.

STARDollars Stablecoin Redevelopment: The protocol's USD-pegged stablecoin, STARDollars, has been overhauled with significant upgrades and integrated partnerships. The stablecoin, which had previously depreciated, has been redesigned to provide highly secure and optimal yields.

Revenue Multiplying Gamification Technology: New contracts have been introduced to boost revenue generation within the protocol. These include STARPower Generators and STARP deflationary tokens. These token-generating virtual items offer a unique, time-increasing percentage increase in revenues produced by STARV2, StarStations, and StarDollars.

Decentralized DAO-Controlled Treasury: The protocol now includes a fully decentralized DAO-controlled treasury. Its purpose is to harness collective human intelligence to maximize returns on deployed DEX/DAO trading strategies. This new feature aims to optimize the management of assets and resources within the protocol by leveraging the knowledge and insights of the DAO's participants.
