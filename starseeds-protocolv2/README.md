# StarSeeds Protocol V2

Many core contracts within the StarSeeds Protocol have been significantly improved in order to increase returns, liquidity and stability for the StarSeeds Protocols ecosystem. In addition, new contracts that enhance existing systems have been deployed.

1. Existing Contract Upgrades: StarStations and Command Bridges are now stakeable items. Users may collect their tokens at any time rather then receiving a weekly airdrop. This increases Protocol revenues by decreasing gas fees and putting more control in the hands of our Users.\

2. STARV2 Capital Enhancing SuperPool Liquidity: Previously the StarSeeds Protocols STARV1 used a STAR - MAI V2 Liquidity Pool (LP for short) hosted [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8440178087C4fd348D43d0205F4574e0348a06F0\&swapIndex=0\&currency0=0x17840DF7CAa07e298b16E8612157B90ED231C973). This locked up critical resources in a way that generated little value for the Protocol or our users. \

3. STARDollars: our Protocols's USD pegged stablecoin, previously depreciated, has been completely redesigned with major upgrades and partnership integrations that provide the most significant and secure yield that we can. \

4. Revenue Multiplying Gamification Technology: Including STARPower Generators, STARP deflationary tokens,  are a new set of revenue enhancing contracts. These token generating virtual items provide a unique percentage increase that increases over time to the revenues produced by STARV2, StarStations, and StarDollars. \

5. 100% decentralized DAO Controlled Treasury designed to aggregate collective human intelligence for the purpose of maximizing returns on deployed DEX/DAO trading strategies \
