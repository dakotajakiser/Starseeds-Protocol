# The StarSeeds Protocol

The StarSeeds Protocol is a decentralized trading strategy optimizer designed to provide consistent revenue while reducing risk/volatility and simultaniously increasing profits/security for our users.\
\
StarSeeds Platform users benefit from advantages once traditionally reserved exclusively for expert traders, financial instituations and well connected accreddited investors. \
\
Rather then dealing with choosing between the hundreds of thousands of trading strategies currently available, our users simply buy STAR, then either stake STAR for a consistent return, or convert STAR into StarStations, interest bearing virtual assets with historical vAPRs ranging from 35-100%+. \
\
100% of the StarSeeds Protocol's code is deployed on immuteable infastructure. Which means the program and funds utilized by it cannot be shut down, hacked, censored, stolen, seized, or destroyed. \
