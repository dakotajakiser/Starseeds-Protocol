# The StarSeeds Protocol

The StarSeeds Protocol is a DAO operated DeFi trading strategy optimizer designed to maximize revenues while reducing risk/drawdown and simultaniously increasing consistency/security for our users.\
\
StarSeeds Platform users benefit from advantages once traditionally reserved exclusively for expert traders, financial instituations and well connected accreddited investors.\
\
Rather then choosing between the hundreds of thousands of trading strategies currently available, our users simply buy STAR, then either stake STAR or convert STAR into StarStations for a regular return.\
\
100% of the StarSeeds Protocols code is deployed on immutable infrastructure. Which means the network of smart contracts and funds utilized within cannot be shut down, hacked, censored, stolen, seized, or destroyed.
