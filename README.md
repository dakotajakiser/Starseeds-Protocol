# The StarSeeds Protocol

The StarSeeds Protocol is a DAO operated DeFi trading strategy optimizer designed to maximize revenues while reducing risk/drawdown and simultaneously increasing consistency/security for our users.\
\
StarSeeds Platform users benefit from advantages once traditionally reserved exclusively for expert traders, financial institutions and well connected accredited investors.\
\
Rather then choosing between the hundreds of thousands of trading strategies currently available, our users simply buy STAR, then either stake STAR or convert STAR into yield providing virtual items.\
\
100% of the StarSeeds Protocols code is deployed on immutable infrastructure. Which means the network of smart contracts and the tokens held within can only be controlled by the DAO that governs the Protocol.
