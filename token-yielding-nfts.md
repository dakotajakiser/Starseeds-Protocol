# Token Yielding NFTs

Real Yield producing virtual assets are a core component of the StarSeeds (SS) Protocol's Treasury management and user revenue distribution systems. \
\
Everytime a SS Protocol NFT is minted, the tokens used are transferred to a StarSeeds DAO Treasury Multi-Sig Safe. From there, the StarSeeds DAO allocates those tokens into an adaptive portfolio of defi trading strategies. \
\
As returns are produced, the largest portion of the gains are automatically used to buy SS Protocol tokens from the market, which are then distributed to SS Protocol NFT holders via token streaming contracts.\
\
While most SS Protocol NFTs provide yield from the aggregate total of all SS Treasury accounts, special limited supply Collections provide yield from a specific sub-set of strategies, typically at a higher return rate then standard SS NFTs. \
\
While there is no guaranteeing the future, SS Protocol Yield NFTs are designed to and intended to produce yield continuously without an shut-off/expiration date.&#x20;
