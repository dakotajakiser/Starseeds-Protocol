# DAO Treasury Management + Token Yielding NFTs

**StarSeeds (SS) Protocol: Real Yield & NFTs**

Real Yield producing virtual assets are a core component of the StarSeeds (SS) Protocol's Treasury management and user revenue distribution systems.

**Minting Process of SS Protocol NFTs**

* Every time a SS Protocol NFT is minted, the tokens used are transferred to a StarSeeds DAO Treasury Multi-Sig Safe.
* The StarSeeds DAO then allocates those tokens into an adaptive portfolio of defi trading strategies.

**Yield Production & Distribution**

* As returns are generated, the major chunk of the gains are channeled into buying StarSeeds Protocol tokens from the market.
* These acquired tokens are subsequently distributed to StarSeeds Protocol NFT holders via token streaming contracts.

**NFTs & Yield Categories**

* A majority of StarSeeds Protocol NFTs yield from the cumulative total of all SS Treasury accounts.
* However, select limited supply NFT Collections provide yield from a distinct sub-set of strategies, often yielding at a rate surpassing that of the standard SS NFTs.

**Longevity of StarSeeds Protocol Yield NFTs**

While the future remains uncertain, StarSeeds Protocol Yield NFTs are ingeniously crafted to consistently generate yield without any predefined termination date.
