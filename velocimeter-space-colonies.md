# Velocimeter Space Colonies

These Special Edition Commemorative NFTs represent digital Space Colonies that produce tokenized resources (DEX trade-able ERC20 tokens) on an hourly basis for their holders.&#x20;



This Unique Collection was deployed on the Fantom network to commemorate the partnership between the Velocimeter and StarSeeds Protocols. \


Holders of one or more Colonies become the beneficiary of a stakeholder registry streaming contract, which receives 30%\* of fees/incentives from StarSeeds Protocol Liquidity and veFVM on Velocimeterâ€™s FVM.exchange. In addition, 1,000,000 units of STARP and 3,000 STARv2 have been allocated for distribution to collection holders. $45K worth of tokens (at time of deployment).



Tokens transferred to mint this collection are deposited into FVM.exchange liquidity pools/veFVM and then locked/relocked continuously\*.



The items in this collection are weighted, the first 77 receive 3.5X more tokens from the streaming contract. The next 100 have from 3.3-2.7X more weight, and so on. Only the first 500 have a weight bonus. Maximum total supply of 888.



Based on past data and current market rates, estimated year one vAPR for the first 144 NFTs ranges from 300% - 500%+. Cost to mint these limited edition items increases over time and as more are sold.&#x20;

\*In case of a FVM Protocol exploit (including underlying dependencies) occurring that could significantly affect the StarSeeds Protocol, the StarSeeds DAO may vote to withdraw any amount of LP and veFVM. 2 Years after deployment, the DAO may vote to liquidate up to 33% per year of POL on FVM.&#x20;



\*\*30% collection distribution rate is hard set until 6/1/2024, then subject to change via StarSeeds DAO proposal. Share distribution range is hard locked to 15% minimum and 40% maximum with no expiration.  \
