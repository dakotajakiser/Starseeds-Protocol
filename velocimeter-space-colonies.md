# Velocimeter Space Colonies

These Special Edition Commemorative NFTs represent digital Space Colonies that produce tokenized resources (DEX trade-able ERC20 tokens) on an hourly basis for their holders.&#x20;

Holders of one or more Colonies become the beneficiary of a stakeholder registry streaming contract, which receives 30%\* of fees/incentives from StarSeeds Protocol Liquidity and veFVM on Velocimeterâ€™s FVM.exchange. In addition, 1,000,000 units of STARP and 3,000 STARv2 have been allocated for distribution to collection holders. $45K worth of tokens (at time of deployment).

Tokens transferred to mint this collection are deposited into FVM.exchange liquidity pools/veFVM and then locked/relocked continuously\*.

The items in this collection are weighted, the first 77 receive 3.5X more tokens from the streaming contract. The next 100 have from 3.3-2.7X more weight, and so on. Only the first 500 have a weight bonus. Maximum total supply of 888.

Based on past data and current market rates, estimated year one vAPR for the first 144 NFTs ranges from 300% - 500%+. Cost to mint these limited edition items increases over time and as more are sold. \
