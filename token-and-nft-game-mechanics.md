# Token and NFT Game Mechanics

Martian Flip Cruiser\
&#x20;A level 1 Cruiser can only last for a maximum of four 7 day missions. \
\
Can be minted with 1 STARv2 or by Andromedas Homeships. Upgrading to level 2 costs 1 STARv2, 100 STARMaterials and 20 STARCredits. Level two cruisers have 3.5X times the mission endurance and 2.2X the yield of level 1 cruisers. \
\
After a cruiser has expended its endurance, it can be melted down in a Arcturian moon station. A Level 1 cruiser gives between 3-15 STARMaterials and 1-3 STARCredits (Depending on the level of the Moon Station and its STAR Power Boost level). A Level 2 Cruiser gives between 10-35 STARMaterials and 4-12 STARCredits\

StarPower Generators\
\
STARPG LV1: Costs 100 STARP and 5 STARV2 to mint. Generates either 0.7 or 1.5 STARP  per day, depending on staking method. The first staking method is free. The second costs 3 STARv2 and 70 STARP. \
\
STARP LV2: Costs a Level 1 STARPG, 300 STARP and 10 STARv2 to mint. Generates 3/7 STARP per day.The first staking method is free. The second costs 10 STARv2 and 150 STARP. \
\
STARP LV3: Costs a Level 2 STARPG, 1,000 STARP and 20 STARv2 to mint. Generates 6/12 STARP and 0.05 or 0.2 STARC per day. The first staking method is free. The second costs 20 STARv2 and 300 STARP. \
\
All rates can be modified via StarSeeds Protocol DAO Vote. \
\
Andromeda Mothership\
As a base, Homeships produce 1.15 STARv2 worth of other ships for every STARv1 they would typically produce. \
\
Homeships can be upgraded up to 8 times.  The first four upgrades grant either a 3% bonus (per level) to STARv2 production, or a 5% bonus towards producing other stations. The final three upgrades allow the homeship to produce both STARv2 and other Ships, at the cost of expending additional STARAlloys, STARPower, and STARCredits.\
\
At level 6, a homestation can reduce ship making or star forging efficiency by 30% in exchange for 45% efficiency in the other activity. \
\
At level 7, efficiency reduction is reduced to 25% while the alternative activity efficiency increases to 50%. \
\
At level 8, the reduction goes down to 15% while the alternative efficiency increases to 60%\
\
Martian Destroyer\
\
Level 1 has a staking option that requires no STARPower and provides the base return set by the StarSeeds Protocol. (Target 30% APR). By spending 100 STARPower per day, return rate increases by 1% plus 5% of base APR. By spending 10 STARFuel per day, return rate increases by another 5%. \
\
Each level up increases the return rate by a flat 1% + 5% of the base, the STARPOWER/STARFuel cost by 3 times, and the boost rate for using STARPower/STARFuel by a flat 3% of the last levels base. (At level 2, the boost from using 300 STARPower per day would be 8%).\
\
Boost from STARPower/STARFuel usage is multiplied, not added.  \
