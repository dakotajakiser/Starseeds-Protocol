# High Yield/High Volume Stablecoin Strategy

Through proper application of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) nearly anyone in the world can benefit from return rates typically reserved for elite investors, and without suffering from the volatility that comes with standard cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. \
\
Primary risks from this strategy come from the underlying Stablecoins, [DAI](https://docs.makerdao.com/), [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/usdc-risk-factors), [USDT](https://tether.to/en/), and [USDR](https://www.tangible.store/realusd). If any of the Stablecoins depeg, then funds held in this strategy will be at risk of depreciation of the intial asset. This risk can be mitigated by maintaining awareness of market conditions and being prepared to liquidate this strategy if any of the four underlying assets show signs of instability. Smart protocols can be utilized to automatically mitigate this risk.\
\
Additional risks include the security of the underlying protocols [Curve](https://classic.curve.fi/risks), [Aave](https://docs.aave.com/risk/), [Convex ](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/risks)and potentially [Harvest Finance](broken-reference). To learn more read the risks section located in the docs of each protocol listed. \
\
Step 1:  Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), add the [Matic Chain](https://polygon.technology/), secure and backup your wallet, then deposit some matic or matic chain tokens into your account. \
\
Step 2. Go to the [USDR3Pool Curve](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/pools/factory-v2-339/deposit) Liquidity Pool (LP for short). Connect your wallet and select the Polygon Chain. One coin at a time, type 1000 into each of the 4 token options and see which option gives you the best depost rate. \
\
Step 3. Go to [inch1.io](https://1inch.io/) Whichever currency give the best rate then and purchase the token that gives your the best rate. If USDR is giving the best rate then purchase DAI from 1inch, then go to the USDR site and mint new USDR. Then deposit into the Curve LP. \
\
Step 4. Do not stake your LP tokens on the Curve site. Instead go to [Convex ](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake)or [Harvest Finance](https://old.harvest.finance/) and deposit your LP tokens there for a higher return. Harvest Finance gives the highest return and autocompounds the vast majority of the return, wheras Convex has much higher TVL (over 3 Billion USD as of 5/21/2023), compared to Harvest Finance's 10M+ TVL. Theoritically this means that Convex may be more secure then Harvest Finance. \
\
Step 5. Visit the Curve or Harvest Claim page periodically for to claim your additional interest. If using Curve, claiming and compounding your interest on a regular basis will significantly affect your APY.&#x20;

Update: Use the adaptation for this strategy instead of following Step 5 to more then double yield.
