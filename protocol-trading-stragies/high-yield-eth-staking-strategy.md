# High Yield ETH Staking Strategy

Through proper application of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) holders of ETH can earn exceptional returns with very little to no additional risk compared to holding ethereum in self owned secured cold storage. \
\
Additional risks come from protocols [LIDO](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits), [AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/risk/), and [MakerDAO](https://security.makerdao.com/). Click on the hyperlinked text for audit reports and risk assessments.  \
\
Go to the [Oasis Aave wstETH yield multipler](https://oasis.app/earn/aave/v3/open/wstETHeth#simulate). Deposit ETH. \
Recommendation: Set the liquidation ratio to 5-8% of the maximum possible, to account for short-term market fluctations between the exchange rate of wstETH and ETH. \
\
This particular strategy does not carry the risk of liquidation depending on the price of ETH. ETH price can go down 99%+ without liquidation. \
