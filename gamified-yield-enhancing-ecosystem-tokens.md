# Gamified Yield Enhancing Ecosystem Tokens

The V2 StarSeeds ecosystem introduces a gamified approach to tokens, items, and staking contracts, offering individuals with limited funds an opportunity to incrementally grow their holdings. This gamification not only provides a fun and engaging experience but also incentivizes users to keep their liquidity within the StarSeeds ecosystem, facilitating continuous yield compounding.

The gamification's ultimate goal is to enhance the base, regenerative yields provided to platform users. The system introduces several new tokens and items that interact with each other to produce this outcome.

STARCredits is a token that serves as the gateway to the more gamified elements of the platform. It is directly paired with STARv2 and other tokens within the game ecosystem.

STARMatter is a resource harvested by Martial Flip and Arcturian Moon Stations, both of which are part of the gamified ecosystem.

STARAlloys are crafted by Arcturian Moon Stations using STARMatter.

STARPower is generated by STARPGenerators within the ecosystem.

STARMatter and STARAlloys play an essential role in the gamified ecosystem, as they are used in conjunction with STARCredits and STARPower to upgrade StarStations. Upgrading StarStations enhances their daily yield production.

STARFuel is another vital token within the gamified ecosystem, acting as a direct yield enhancer for the most potent STARv2 NFT staking options. It can be spent to boost yields for specific staking options, providing users with increased returns.

In conclusion, the gamified yield-enhancing ecosystem tokens introduced in the V2 StarSeeds protocol provide a novel approach to DeFi participation. By incorporating elements of gameplay, the protocol creates a more engaging user experience while incentivizing users to lock their liquidity within the ecosystem, ultimately boosting the yields offered on the platform.
