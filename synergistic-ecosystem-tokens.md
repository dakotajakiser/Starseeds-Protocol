# Synergistic Ecosystem Tokens

With the introduction of the StarSeeds Protocol V2, several new tokens and items with distinct benefits have been added to the protocol. These additions aim to enhance the yield of STARv2 and provide users with USD-pegged and delta-neutral strategies.

**STARDollars** is an over-collateralized stabletoken backed by Wusdr/USD+/gDAI. It offers holders both capital appreciation and dividend payments. The token utilizes Curve and Balancer stabletoken technologies to increase liquidity. For higher gains, users can convert STARDollars into wSTARD for a minimum of one week. This allows the protocol to farm the underlying Wusdr/USD+, typically doubling or more the returns compared to holding the token alone.

**STARPower** is a deflationary farm token with more flexible issuance compared to the highly-regulated STARv2. STARPower has multiple utility and value sources:

1. It can be burned to mint, stake, or upgrade a STARPower Generator (NFT Vault) that produces a yield paid in STARP and eventually STARC, a token backed by revenues from the StarSeeds Treasury of DAO governance holdings and decentralized trading strategies.
2. STARPower can be burned to increase yields for staking other StarSeeds Protocol tokens and virtual items.
3. STARPower is primarily meant for farming rather than trading, which is evident in its 20% burn and 10% tax on transfer.
4. Burning STARPower permanently reduces the maximum supply, originally set at 10 million, and is designed to align STARPower's market value with the value of the StarSeeds Protocol ecosystem.

STARPower and STARPower Generator yield-producing NFTs are initially launching on the Fantom blockchain.\

STARCredits are tokens mintable against collateral including interest bearing LP positions.&#x20;

The new tokens and items in the protocol include a complex system of burns, taxes, and staking mechanisms, allowing for different rates depending on the tier or account interacting with the system. The protocol features rebasing for qualified accounts and tiered lending systems for STARC and STARC-B tokens, with different interest rates and conversion ratios for each tier.

The STARC Bank is an integral part of the protocol, responsible for maintaining the peg of the STARC token. It utilizes non-borrowed funds, such as purchased STARv2 and STARD, to achieve this goal. The bank is also authorized to deploy held tokens for staking to produce additional returns. The introduction of the STARC Bank and the tiered lending system allows for increased flexibility and control over the protocol's assets, ensuring the stable value of STARC and optimizing returns for users.

In conclusion, the StarSeeds Protocol V2 introduces several enhancements and additions to its ecosystem, providing users with a more sophisticated and rewarding DeFi experience. The combination of new tokens, items, and mechanisms ensures greater liquidity, stability, and yield potential for the protocol and its users.
