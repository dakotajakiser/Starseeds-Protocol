# DAO Origin Relics

This NFT collection was deployed to commemorate, honor and reward long-term supporters of one of the StarSeeds Protocols predecessor projects, the DAO Fund. Holders of this item are granted an ongoing revenue stream of StarSeeds Protocol Ecosystem tokens. \
\
With a total maximum supply of 111 units, this is the rarest collection within the StarSeeds Protocol ecosystem. \
\
In total, 3K STARv2, 10K STAR, 20K STARGOV, 50K STARC, 100K STARM, and 300K STARP have been reserved for distribution to DAO Relic Holders until 1/1/2025. As of 9/2023 that is a over $70K market value in tokens. \
\
At current market rate, each DAO Origin Relic will distribute about $630 worth of tokens in the next 14 months. DAO Tokens can currently be purchased for around 3 cents, giving DAO Origin Relics a current mint cost of about $30. \
\
The vAPR for DAO Origin Relics for year one is over 2000% (at the time of writing). Since there is an extremely limited supply of DAO tokens in circulation (Less than 50K), by the time the DAO Origin Relic Collection is fully minted, the market value of DAO will be over $3 each. \
