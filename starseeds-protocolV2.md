# STARSEEDS PROTOCOL V2

Many core contracts within the StarSeeds Protocol have been significantly improved in order to increase returns, liquidity and stability for the StarSeeds Protocols ecosystem.

1. StarStations and Command Stations are now stakeable items. Users may collect their tokens at any time rather then a weekly airdrop. This decreases Protocol Gas fees while putting more power in the hands of the User.

2. Previously the StarSeeds Protocols STARV1 used a STAR - MAI V2 Liquidity Pool (LP for short) hosted [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8440178087C4fd348D43d0205F4574e0348a06F0\&swapIndex=0\&currency0=0x17840DF7CAa07e298b16E8612157B90ED231C973).

Since the initial launch of Star, many DeFi Protocols have been upgraded for more efficient trading with built in LP yields and lower fees, which result in a greater return for stakers and lower costs for traders.&#x20;

STARV2 is being deployed on a complex, multilayered set of [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/) liquidity pools that use custom smart logic with other layer three protocols to increase ecosystem profitability and stability while reducing costs. Finalized STARV2 LP will contain a mixture of 20% STARV2: The primary upgraded token of the StarSeeds Protocol, which increases in value over time via

1. Buy and burns from 20% of the revenues from trading strategies deployed by the StarSeeds DAO
2. 30% of balancer incentive gauge rewards from StarSeeds Protocol owned STARV2 balancer LP.
3. 30% of the trading fees from the StarSeeds Balancer STARV2 LP arbitrage trading bot.
4. 100% of revenue generated from all Strategies deployed in the STARV2 Balancer LP.
5. 100% of the increase in value of volatile tokens deployed in STARV2 Balancer LP. (Remaining gains from the above mentioned activities to be deployed by the StarSeeds DAO.)

10% wSTARV2. A yield bearing version of STARV2 with an additional 12% APY.

25% [MVLP](https://app.metavault.trade/#/buy_mvlp) a managed portfolio of 10 top cryptocurrencies, BTC(31%), ETH(31%), Matic(8%), stMatic, Chainlink, Aave, Dai(5%), USDC(12%), USDT(8%), BUSD, that is arbitraged and utilized for decentralized binary, leverage and automated trading services to produce 40%+ APR at the time of writing. Portfolio perportions subject to change pending market conditions.

[Olive Finance](https://oliveapp.finance/earn/vaults/mvlp-high-yield-polygon) a autocompounding yield enhancer for MVLP tokens that increases return to over 80% APY at time of writing. 

15% [VeTetu](https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/tetu-v2/vetetu) One of the most promising small cap gems on the market, Vetetu stakers benefit from revenues from over 40 complex strategied. Vetetu is also used to maximize gains from tusdc vault tokens and to increase balancer gauge incentives to STARV2 LP to further increase native STARV2 APY. 

10% [QiDAO/TetuQi](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xd80ef9fabfdc3b52e17f74c383cf88ee2efbf0b6000000000000000000000a65), a balancer incentive boosted LP with part QiDAO, one of the best small cap gem tokens on the market paired to TetuQi, a liquid interest equivilent with an incredible 150%+ APR at time of writing (when boosted by locked tetubal).

10% [TUSDC](https://v2.tetu.io/) a Complex Multilayered Stabletoken vault strategy offering over 30% APY at time of writing when bllsted by VeTetu.

5% [Tetubal](https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/yield-farm/strategies/tetubal) A Tetu liquid wrapper for vebal that receives revenues from the entire balancer ecosystem. Used to vote to increase balancer gauge incentives and to increase return rate from Qi-TetuQI Balancer LP. Over 15% APY at time of writing.

3% [MaticX/Aave Matic BP](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe78b25c06db117fdf8f98583cdaaa6c92b79e917000000000000000000000b2b)a balancer LP with network staked matic combined with matic staked on Aave for 7%+ APR at time of writing. Added as a easy one step route for trades in and out of STARV2 liquidity.

[Aave](https://app.aave.com/), a decentralized lending market that provides interest for many major cryptocurrency tokens. 

2% [wUSDR](https://www.tangible.store/) A Stabletoken offering real estate backed growth currently accruing over 15% APY at time of writing. Added as a easy one step route for trades in and out of STARV2 liquidity.

Significant development of custom balancer LP smart logic alongside custom StarSeed 3475 Vaults and smart wrappers are neccesary to deploy the final version of the STARV2 pool. 

At the current Phase of development, we have

1. Gotten whitelisted by the balancer DAO for STARV2. You can find our token easily by typing star into the polygon balancer search engine.
2. Created and whitelisted the 80mooMvxMVLP20wUSDR balancer LP. (mooMvxMVLP is a beefy finance autocompounding version of MVLP)

Next we are releasing the first version of STARV2 LP that will be paired 40% STARV2 with 60% 80mooMvxMVLP20wUSDR. Following that we are launching proposals in the Balancer DAO to obtain a Gauge for 40V2STAR60mooMvxMvLPwUSDR pool. After which our LP will qualify for incentive rewards from Balancer. 

As we work on developing the smart logic for the customer balancer Pool stack, the Starseeds DAO Portfolio of trading strategies will be enacting the above methods without using balancer LP, alongside other lucrative strategies not useable within LP. 

Users will have two options to convert STARV1 to STARV2. 

Option 1: Staking contract.
Permanetly lock STARV1 and receive 60% APR in STARV2 for 2.5 years until 1.50x units of STARV2 per each locked STARV1 are obtained. 

Option 2: Direct Swap.
Swap STARV1 direct for STARV2 at a market set rate in our quickswap V3 liquidity pool preset with 10K units of STARV1 and 4K units of STARV2,  concentrated at 0.20-0.75 STARV1 to STARV2. Initial exchange rate of 0.5 STARV1 to STARV2.

STARV2 starting price will be set to $7.50.

To convert V1 StarStations to V2 StarStations, 35% of the STARV1 used to create each V1 Station must be burned. 

Command Bridges convertable at no additional cost. 

A new V3 DAO to STARV1 pool will be released with 10,000 DAO and 3,300 STARV1 concentrated between 5.5 DAO per STARV1 and 2 DAO per STARV1. Starting at a ratio of 3.3 DAO per STARV1

DAO tokens will also be directly convertable to STARV2 StarStations at a rate of 5 DAO per STARV2. Or a rate of 3 DAO and 0.4 STARV1 per STARV2. No locking period on V2 StarStations obtained this way. 

Contact admin to swap your locked V1 StarStations for V2.

V1 StarStations emissions have been discontinued. 

All numeric variables subject to change via an approved StarSeeds DAO Proposal.
