# StarStation Tutorial

Steps 1-5 are for people new to crypto. If you already have a loaded metamask account skip to step 6.&#x20;

1. In order to mint your first Star Station you will need a Metamask account. [Get one here](https://metamask.io/). Alternatively you can use a [Brave Crypto Wallet](https://brave.com/download/).&#x20;
2. After installing your account, please secure your account appropriately.
3. On mobile devices, open Metamask and go to the browser. Then navigate to the [StarSeeds URL](https://starseeds-protocol.eth.limo/#/). On desktop devices, just click on the URL.&#x20;
4. Click connect wallet on the top right. Approve the Metamask pop-up. Approve the second Metamask pop-up (if it occurs).&#x20;
5. Then go to your Metamask wallet. Click "Buy". Purchase some Matic (on Polygon Mainnet) with bank wire, debit, or credit. \

6. Go back to the StarSeed's Exchange, click "Trade Star" on the bottom left-hand-side menu. Approve the pop-up on the next page. Trade your Matic for STAR.&#x20;
7. Then go to the [Star Station](https://starseeds-protocol.eth.limo/#/starStations) page. Mint a station. After mint, Station(s) will show up on the [Inventory](https://starseeds-protocol.eth.limo/#/starStationsWallet) page.
8. Each week you continue holding your Star Station(s), you will receive a transfer of STAR. You can then go to the "Trade Star" menu option to liquidate your STAR into most other forms of cryptocurrency.\
