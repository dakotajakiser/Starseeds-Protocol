# StarStations

Star Stations are digital items that distribute revenues (as an automated weekly transfer) generated by Star Protocols.\
\
When a StarStation is created, the funds used are transferred into Star Protocols and put to work earning fees from various expert trading activities such as providing liquidity, DAO governance participation, and automated arbitrage. \
\
Most of of returns generated from these activities are then transferred to StarStation Holders. The remaining returns are used to expand the portfolio of revenue generating strategies.&#x20;
