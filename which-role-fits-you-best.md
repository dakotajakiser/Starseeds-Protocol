**For Agents of DAO Operated Protocols: Increase Protocol Revenues and Liquidity using methods you've (probably) never seen before.**&#x20;

If you are already familiar with on-chain V3 liquidity management, ve 3,3 locking mechanisms, rebasing flywheels, and leveraging high yield liquidity pools.... then you'll likely be excited to adopt same-chain and omni-chain arbitrage trading bot networks to further increase daily revenues/trading volume from naturally occurring market movements that happen thousands of times a day.&#x20;

If you're not familiar with the above, well...\
1\. Implementing on-chain managed V3 liquidity is more then 25 times more profitable then standard V2 Liquidity.\
2\. ve 3,3, Tokenomics and rebasing flywheel DEX mechanisms increase and retain liquidity and volume by more then 4 times the standard. \
3\. Effective application of LP leverage increases revenue by up to 7 times \
\
These mechanisms act as force multipliers, increasing profitability by over a 100 times compared to old-school v2 LP farming. \
\
4\. Protocol owned arbitrage bot nets alongside programmatic LP Arb exclusivity increases LP trading volume on average more then 5 times while increasing profit margins on trading volume over 200% on average. \
\
That's another 10X increase in profitability. \
