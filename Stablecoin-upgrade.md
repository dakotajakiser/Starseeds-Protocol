This is a yield enhancing upgrade to the high yieldnstablecoin strategy.\
\
Rather then staking USDR-am3CRV Curve LP into harvest finance, LP is placed into the Tangible Store Midas VaultÂ https://app.midascapital.xyz/137/pool/14. After which either USDC/USDT is obtained as loan at a rate of 72% LTV. Loaned tokens are then placed back into the initial Curve LP. Then another USDC/USDT loan is taken out. This process is then repeated 6 times.

Finally, a USDC/USDT loan is taken out a 7th time and the total is traded to DAI and deposited in the same vault.

This strategy increases yield by over 200% compared to the older adaptation.
