# STARV2

Previously the StarSeeds Protocol's STARV1 used a STAR - MAI V2 Liquidity Pool (LP for short) hosted [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8440178087C4fd348D43d0205F4574e0348a06F0\&swapIndex=0\&currency0=0x17840DF7CAa07e298b16E8612157B90ED231C973). Since our initial launch, many DeFi Protocols have been upgraded for more efficient trading with built in interest and lower fees, which results in a greater return for stakers and lower costs for traders.&#x20;

STARV2 LP is launching on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/swap), and [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), while using layer three protocols to increase ecosystem profitability and security while reducing costs. [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/), [StakeDAO](https://stakedao.org/), [Enzyme](https://enzyme.finance/), [Aave](https://app.aave.com/), [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/markets?market=usdc-mainnet), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [Arrakis](https://www.arrakis.finance/), [QiDAO](https://www.mai.finance/), [MakerDAO](starseeds-dao/), [Revert ](https://revert.finance/)and others are being incorporated into the base Liquidity Pools backing STARV2.

At first glance it may appear that we are diluting liquidity across three locations. That is not the case. Rather we are merging 3 seperate multi-layered LPs and 2 tokens into into a Five token Protocol Pool on [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/).&#x20;

Our STARV2-wUSDR LP on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is necessary for our token to show up quickly on price oracles and token charts/trackers. This pool also gives us much greater control over the price range of STARV2.&#x20;

[wUSDR](https://www.tangible.store/realusd) is a real estate/rent/insurance/dai backed stablecoin currently offering 17% APY automatically wrapped and held in the value of the token.&#x20;

Since STARV2 is paired to wUSDR in the V3 Uniswap pool, interest accrued to the wUSDR will be directly applied to STARV2 in the V3 pool. Which gives the STARV2 in that LP a 17% APY.

We are utilizing LP on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/swap) used with [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), auto compounding, liquid staking wrappers, and curve vote gauges to maximize interest earned on our STAR3CRV and STARBLESS Curve V2 LP.&#x20;

All of the above mentioned LP is being placed into a boosted protocol LP holding wSTARV2, STAR3CRV, SRBTCETHS, STARV2-wUSDR and one token TBD. This pool is intended to be named SUPERSTAR

Based on current and historical return rates, SUPERSTAR LP is expected to have an inherent 24-38% annual price increase (before fees and buying pressure) provided by layers of financial mechanisms from the protocol integrations.&#x20;

This interest rate is expected to increase over time as we \
1\. Reduce the amount of wSTARV2 in the pool to about 30%.\
2\. Obtain Balancer and Curve vote gauges for STAR LP so that the SUPERSTAR LP will be provided with additional incentives from Curve and Balancer in addition to trading fees.\
3\. Release liquid auto compounding wrapper for SUPERSTAR that comes with an additional 12-28% APR paid in STARGOV and bond discounts for Stations. \
4\. Deploying our revamped V2 Equilibrium LP trading bot to collect additional revenues from all STARV2 LPs by swing trading arbitraging, wrapping/unwrapping, and maintaining the StarSeeds DAO's scheduled STARV2 price range. \
\
Estimate APY projections for wSUPERSTAR at 50-85% for the first 12-24 months after the pool is released.&#x20;
