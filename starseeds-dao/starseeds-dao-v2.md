# StarSeeds DAO V2

With the upcoming release of V2 of our protocol, several major upgrades are being introduced.\
\
1\. The StarSeed's DAO will be holding reflection votes for every DAO that the Protocol has POL in. Thus members of the StarSeed's DAO will be able to vote on a wide variety of DAOs (and receive bribes) by participating. \
\
2\. A regular gauge vote will decide allocation of excess resources into DEX trading strategies. Users that pick options that end up performing over the median average will be awarded. Users may delegate their votes to specalists with proven track histories. \
\
3\. In order to qualify for [Balancers grant program](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/introducing-balancers-80-20bpt-launchpad-f5e4ffdb3511), Command Bridges will evetually shift to being mintable only with 80STARV2/20BAL BP.  Furthermore, following [Beethovens Reliquary program](https://docs.beets.fi/beets/mabeets), Command BridgeV2s will mature over time with a set cap, and will come with a significant portion of platform revenues. \
\
4\. Command BridgeX will allow users to vote on critical platform decisions, and nothing else. For other vote types the highest paying/rewarding option will be chosen for all gauge and reflection votes, maximizing yield in a manner similar to [xtetubal](https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/yield-farm/strategies/tetubal#xtetubal).
