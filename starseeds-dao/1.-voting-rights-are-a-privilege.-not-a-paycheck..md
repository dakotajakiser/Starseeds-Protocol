# 1. Voting Rights are a Privilege. Not a Paycheck.

Currently; The majority of DEFI oriented DAOs award interest payments and bribe revenues to platform governance token stakers and active participants. The primary incentive to vote is to increase personal profits. Decisions are being made that benefit the individual at the cost of the collective and this is not good for business.

By comparison, there is no direct monetary reward for participating in the StarSeed’s DAO.

Furthermore resources are required to gain a seat at our voting table. Resources that can only be earned by contributing to our platform and ecosystem.

Investors who are more interested in personal profit rather then collective gain are able to make higher returns placing their resources purely into our revenue generating platform assets (Star Stations) as opposed to governance related assets (Command Bridges).

Thus the people running the StarSeed’s DAO are the people that have contributed the most, with pure intentions to make decisions that truly benefit the entirety of the DAO.
