# Critical Voting Decisions Can't be Bribed.

Currently; The majority of DEFI oriented DAOs award interest payments and bribe revenues to platform governance token stakers and active participants. The primary incentive to hold governance tokens is most often to increase personal profits. Decisions are typical made that benefit individual voters despite the cost to the Protocol and this is often not beneficial for Protocol growth.

By comparison, there is no direct reward for participating in the StarSeeds DAO.

Furthermore resource must be temporarily locked to gain votes. Resources that can only be earned by contributing to the Protocol.

Users who are more interested in personal gain rather then Protocol growth are able to make higher returns placing their resources into our revenue generating items (Star Stations) as opposed to governance related items (Command Bridges).

Thus the voters running the StarSeedâ€™s DAO are intended to be people that have contributed to the protocol and who intend to make decisions that benefit the Protocol.

We are planning an upgrade that will reward voters who choose trading strategies that perform over the median average.&#x20;
