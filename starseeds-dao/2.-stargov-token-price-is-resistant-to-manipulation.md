# 2. STARGOV Token Price is Resistant to Manipulation

Tradition DEFI DAO Governance setups allow for a single wealthy party to buy up vast amounts of the Governance token overnight with no safeguards against new parties making poor decisions.

Our Governance Token; STARGOV, is not intended to be bought or sold, as there is a hard-coded 50% transfer fee (automatically burned).

Instead of buying and selling STARGOV, users can create STAR Command Bridge NFTs. Which accumulate STARGOV when staked.

This means that investors wanting voting power in the StarSeedâ€™s DAO need to pay for and hold a long-term position to accumulate voting rights. Thus balancing the influence of any one party or group at any given time.
