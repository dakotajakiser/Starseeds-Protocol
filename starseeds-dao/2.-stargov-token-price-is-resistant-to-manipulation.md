# 2. STARGOV Token Price is Resistant to Manipulation

Tradition DEFI DAO Governance setups allow for a single wealthy party to buy up vast amounts of the Governance token overnight with safeguards against new parties making poor decisions.

Our Governance Token; STARGOV, is not intended to be bought or sold, as there is a hard-coded 50% transfer fee (automatically burned).

Instead of buying and selling STARGOV, users can create STAR Command Bridge NFTs. Every week an airdrop of STARGOV goes out to every wallet holding at least one Command Bridge NFT. Having multiple Command Bridges multiplies the token airdrop rate.&#x20;

This means that investors wanting voting power in the StarSeedâ€™s DAO need to pay for and hold a long-term position to accumulate voting rights. Thus balancing the influence of any one party or group at any given time.
