# StarSeeds Protocol Treasury

The primary purpose of the StarSeeds Protocol is to facilitate the production of increasing revenue streams through the application of decentralized trading strategies guided by the StarSeeds DAO. \
\
The treasury can utilize every other decentralized protocol known and is purposed to own a larger and larger percentage of other protocols over time. Thus creating unique opportunities to generate higher amounts of sustainable revenues then would otherwise be possible. \
\
A portion of revenues from decentralized trading strategies and holdings deployed by the treasury are used each week to transfer rewards to Protocol Stakers/Item holders. At the time of writing, our target base APR for long-hold Item yields is 25-45% APR, and between 12-24% for various liquid staking positions. \
\
This return is designed to be a multiplier on top of the increase of growth of STARv2 and the V2 ecosystem over time.&#x20;
