# Representative Network

The StarSeeds Referral Network provides StarSeeds Representatives (Reps) with a unique virtual item called a HomeStation that grants STARV2 tokens to the staker's wallet.\
\
This feature is intended to incentivize the growth of the StarSeeds Protocol while simultaniously providing a revenue stream to users without significant excess resources.\
\
Each HomeStation carries a unique characteristic; the “StarSeeds Network Contribution Rating”, which is directly related to the owning Rep’s referral link. For each StarStation minted by referred users, the referring Rep's Homestation Contribution Rating increases, which grants the Rep's Homestation a higher reward rate.\

5 points after Rep is approved to create a Homestation.\
0.1 point each time the Rep votes on a proposal in the StarSeeds DAO.\
\
T1 (Points from actions taken by Direct Refferals)\
1 point per STARV2 used to create StarStations/Command Bridges.\
10 points for referring an approved Rep (after they gain 11 points)\
\
T2 (Points from actions taken by users referred by referred Reps)\
0.2 points per STARV2 used to create StarStations.\
2 points for referring an approved Rep (after they gain 11 points).\
\
STARV2 rewards distributed to the StarSeeds Network come from StarSeeds Protocol trading strategies. Initially 15% of all revenues distributed are awarded to the StarSeeds Rep Network.\
\
40% of STARV2 awarded through the Network are permanetly locked to the staked Homestation. Each STARV2 locked this way provides increased rewards in a manner similar to staking a StarStation, with a flat 20% bonus on top of base APR.\
\
The 15% and 40% variables can be adjusted by a collective vote from the StarSeeds DAO.\
\
To join the StarSeeds Network, a user must be referred by an existing Rep and them must pass through an approval process via social media authentication, burning 3 STARV2, or gaining approval from 3 existing Reps with over 50 points each.\
\
This feature is still in testing and is not yet available.
