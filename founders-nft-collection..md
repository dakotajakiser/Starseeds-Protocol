# Limited Founders Collective with Exceptional Utility.

In anticipation of the launch of StarSeeds Protocol V2 Liquidity pools, we are offering a one-of-a-kind opportunity with the introduction of the Founders NFT series. This series comes with an exceptional set of benefits for holders, including a permanent percentage of StarSeeds Protocol Portfolio returns, a portion of all ecosystem token taxes, a fixed percentage of the StarSeeds DAO's voting power, exclusive voting rights, and a percentage of every sponsored fork of the StarSeed's Protocol that will ever be created.

The vAPR for this NFT series surpasses the return on all other StarSeeds Protocol NFTs by a significant margin. The series is divided into four tiers:

* Tier 1: Origin Relics (maximum supply of 333)
* Tier 2: Planetary Shipyards (maximum supply of 22)
* Tier 3: Fleet Motherships (maximum supply of 7)
* Tier 4: StarSeeds Planetary Spaceship (maximum supply of 3)

**Origin Relics:** Each of the limited 333 Origin Relics comes with a set of unique advantages:

* Eligibility for an enhanced staking option on almost every part of the V2 ecosystem (higher yields), with the exact enhancement varying between a 5-15% increase depending on strategy and option.
* Monthly benefits spread across the collection include an additional 22% of all STARv2 and STARD rewards distributed to all platform users , 11% of all revenues from all StarSeeds Protocol-owned holdings with options for transfer in eth/usd, and an extra 22% of all STARGOV emitted.
* The StarSeeds Protocol has strong incentives to acquire any under-median priced Origin Relics, likely driving significant demand.
* Origin Relics can be upgraded into Interplanetary Shipyards with multiplied benefits.





**Planetary Shipyards:** A maximum of 22 Origin NFTs can be upgraded into "Planetary Shipyards" for 1000 STARv2 per upgrade, featuring:

* Tripled previous airdrop benefits.
* A flat rate of 10,000 STARP and 1,000 STARC each month (estimated $100-$400 worth).
* Additional STARGOV equal to 10 command bridges (worth 11 STARv2 each).
* Creation of up to 40 STARv2 worth of any StarShip NFT per month (estimated $300-$500).
* Protocol-established resell market with a target minimum bottom floor of 70% of mint value.
* Additional 3-10% enhancement (total of 8-25% yield increase depending on strategy) on nearly all ecosystem staking and holding options.
* Right to make two custom StarSeeds DAO upgrade proposals per year.

**Fleet Motherships:** Seven Planetary Shipyards can be upgraded to Fleet Motherships for 3,000 STARv2, 70,000 STARP, 20,000 STARC, 10,000 STARGOV (estimated cost of $25k), featuring:

* More than tripled previous airdrop benefits.
* Generates 44 command bridge NFTs worth of SSTARGOV, with transfer tax reduced from 50% to 22%.
* Receives 1% of all STARGOV and SSTARGOV transferred.
* Receives 3% of taxes from STARP, STARD, and all other taxed ecosystem token transfers.
* Produces 140 STARv2 worth of starstations per month.
* Original holder gets a signature on protocol-owned treasury multisig accounts.
* May release up to one nonstandard systems upgrade proposal every three months.
* Consensus of 6/7 mothership holders can veto any DAO proposal type except for gauge vote proposals.
* 3% of each gauge voting/resource distribution proposal controlled by each Mothership holder.
* Exclusive right to sponsor forks of the Starseeds protocol with full support from the StarSeeds protocol/community/developers/protocol resources (sponsored forks must grant a minimum 10% of all produced ecosystem assets and revenues to the StarSeeds Protocol).
* Grants an additional 2-5% yield bonus (10-30% depending on option).

The Founders NFT series represents a unique and highly beneficial opportunity for those interested in the StarSeeds Protocol ecosystem.
