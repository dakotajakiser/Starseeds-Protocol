# Martial Flip Cruisers

**Martial Flip Cruiser** can be staked to either gather STARM, or sent on 1 day/3 day/7 day missions to collect STARM and STARC. A level 1 Cruiser can only last for a maximum of four 7 day missions. \
\
Can be minted with 1 STARv2 or by Andromedas Homeships. Upgrading to level 2 costs 1 STARv2, 100 STARMaterials and 20 STARCredits. Level two cruisers have 3.5X times the mission endurance and 2.2X the yield of level 1 cruisers. \
\
After a cruiser has expended its endurance, it can be melted down in a Arcturian moon station. A Level 1 cruiser gives between 3-15 STARMaterials and 1-3 STARCredits (Depending on the level of the Moon Station and its STAR Power Boost level). A Level 2 Cruiser gives between 10-35 STARMaterials and 4-12 STARCredits\
