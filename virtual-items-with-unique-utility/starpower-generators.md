# STARPower Generators

STARPG are a new set of revenue enhancing items that produce STARP. These token generating virtual items provide a unique percentage increase over time to the revenues produced by STARV2, StarStations, and StarDollars. \
\
STARPower Generators can be staked for additional STARP. They can also be upgraded into higher level Generators which increase their STARP yield by burning STARP. At level 3 STARP generators also start to produce STARC, a token backed by revenues generated by the StarSeeds DAO DEX Trading Portfolio. \
\
