# Financially Beneficial Virtual Items

The fad of useless art NFTs has passed. Modern NFT technology all have direct financial applications that when used correctly, result in additional financial gains for the user. \
\
StarSeed's Protocols V2 uses a range of NFT Vault and strategies that increase yields from more basic strategies like buy and hold. We also have a set of gamified Space NFTs that can be used to accrue virtual resources, usable for upgrades that give a yield enhancement to Protocol users. \
\
This set of ecosystem assets is replacing the traditional token airdrop receiving V1 stations used earlier.\
\
**Martial Flip StarStations** can be staked to either gather STARM, or sent on weekly missions to colllect STARC. Each Station can only last for so long before becoming derlict. After which its only use is to be burned to re-gather a small portion of STARM and STARC. \
\
Can be minted with $3 STARv2 or by an Andromedas Leverage Station or Planetary Spaceport and STARM/STARC/STARP. \
