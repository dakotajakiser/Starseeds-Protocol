# Andromeda Homeships

Andromeda Homeships can either produce STARv2, or they can produce a higher amount of Martial Flip Cruisers, STARPower Generators, or Arcturian Moon Stations. As a base, Homeships produce 1.15 STARv2 worth of other ships for every STARv1 they would typically produce. \
\
Homeships can be upgraded up to 8 times.  The first four upgrades grant either a 3% bonus (per level) to STARv2 production, or a 5% bonus towards producing other stations. The final three upgrades allow the homeship to produce both STARv2 and other Ships, at the cost of expending additional STARAlloys, STARPower, and STARCredits.\
\
At level 6, a homestation can reduce ship making or star forging efficiency by 30% in exchange for 45% efficiency in the other activity. \
\
At level 7, efficiency reduction is reduced to 25% while the alternative activity efficiency increases to 50%. \
\
At level 8, the reduction goes down to 15% while the alternative efficiency increases to 60%
