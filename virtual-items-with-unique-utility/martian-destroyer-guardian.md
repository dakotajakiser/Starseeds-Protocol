description: 33 STARv2 to mint
---

# Martian Destroyer Guardian

This ship only produces STARv2, at the cost of a lot of STARPower and potentially STARFuel. 3 upgrade levels. Each one costing a lot STARAlloys and increasing the STARPower requirement for deployment. \
\
Level 1 has a staking option that requires no STARPower and provides the base return set by the StarSeeds Protocol. (Target 30% APR). By spending 100 STARPower per day, return rate increases by 1% plus 5% of base APR. By spending 10 STARFuel per day, return rate increases by another 5%. \
\
Each level up increases the return rate by a flat 1% + 5% of the base, the STARPOWER/STARFuel cost by 3 times, and the boost rate for using STARPower/STARFuel by a flat 3% of the last levels base. (At level 2, the boost from using 300 STARPower per day would be 8%).\
\
Boost from STARPower/STARFuel usage is multiplied, not added. &#x20;
