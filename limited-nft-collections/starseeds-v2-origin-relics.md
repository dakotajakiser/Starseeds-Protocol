# StarSeeds V2 Origin Relics

Unveiling a profound opportunity as we prepare to seed the launch of numerous StarSeeds Protocol V2 Liquidity pools, the Founders NFT series presents an extraordinary array of unique advantages that will never be offered again.&#x20;

* **Ecosystem Fee Benefits**: Enjoy an exceptional 30% portion of all fees from ecosystem token transfers, deposits, and withdrawals, enhancing your potential gains.
* **Fixed DAO Voting Power**: Owners of this collection command a permanent 12% of the StarSeeds DAO's voting power, bestowing upon you the ability to shape the protocol's future.
* **Sponsored Forks Share**: Reap rewards from a percentage of every sponsored fork of the StarSeeds Protocol, firmly establishing your stake in multiple ventures.

As the protocol thrives and flourishes, your returns as a Founders NFT holder will grow in tandem. It's crucial to emphasize that these exceptional NFTs are part of a unique founder's edition collectors series. Unlike future NFT releases with variable returns, these Founders NFTs offer unlimited potential for returns over time.

The StarSeeds Protocol is committed to acquiring as many of these NFTs as possible, ensuring their resale value remains excellent and likely continues to appreciate. The StarSeeds Protocol will never release NFTs like this again. While other StarSeeds NFTs offer a variable range of return based on the initial investment, these founders NFTs have no limitations on the returns they can offer over time.

The highest-tier Founders NFTs even empower you to veto proposals that could potentially harm the ecosystem. These NFTs grant an exclusive seat at founders' virtual meetings, providing you direct insight into the protocol's development. They also endow you with the authority to initiate the approval process for protocols to sponsor.

**Limited Availability and Exceptional Value**

Remarkably, a substantial portion of Tier 2 and Tier 3 NFTs have already been claimed, underscoring their popularity. At present, Tier 1 NFTs are accessible for purchase at under $300, delivering an exceptional opportunity given the potential benefits they entail. A few Tier 2 NFTs remain obtainable at a rate lower than $3000, offering a distinctive chance to secure unmatched advantages.

Act now to seize this exclusive opportunity and become an integral part of the StarSeeds Protocol's legacy and future. Join us on this remarkable journey towards the pinnacle of decentralized finance. All funds raised are directed towards seeding liquidity pools for the V2 launch.
