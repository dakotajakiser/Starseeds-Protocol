The weekly transfer sent out to the StarSeeds Network comes from the StarSeeds Protocol and initially 15% of all revenues distributed are granted to the StarSeeds Network.\

40% of tokens awarded to the StarSeeds Network are utilized to create additional StarStations. All StarStations minted this way grant tokens into the Network to further increase the returns.\
\
The 15% and 40% votes are variable that can be adjusted by a collective vote in the StarSeeds DAO.
